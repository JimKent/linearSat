This contains source code for a program, linearSat, that is part of a system to produce locally
ordered sequence for centromeres and other highly repetitious "satellite" DNA sequences.  To
make this simply type "make" in this directory.  The executable will be in the linearSat/linearSat
file.

The source code is in three directories.  The inc and lib directories contain a subset of the
public domain UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group libraries,  just enough to support the main program
in the linearSat directory.
